# Meshmerize 2024
This repository contains whatever materials I was able to salvage from our entry into MeshMerize 2024 ([Relevant LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dreadnought-robotics_robotics-iitbombaytechfest-roboticsteam-activity-7261763915036975104-k6J8?utm_source=combined_share_message&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)), There isn't much but a simulator and a writeup that I tried doing.

I want to eventually put in all the media from the event and update the writeup more.
